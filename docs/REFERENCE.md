# Reference

The **Spirit** framework is a scientific project.
If you present and/or publish scientific results or
visualisations that used Spirit, you should add a reference.


### The Framework

If you used any components of this framework please add a
reference to our GitHub page.
You may use e.g. the following TeX code:
