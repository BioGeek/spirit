UI - Python
------------

This folder contains python command line interface scripts (of course a
GUI could theoretically be added) making use of the Spirit core shared
library. They are meant for use on clusters or headless devices or usage
in repetitive tasks.

This should hopefully run with both Python2 and Python3, but it is not
well-tested.
